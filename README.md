# Trivial Connections on Discrete Surfaces: Demo

This is a demo application of the basic features discussed in Keenan Crane's [Trivial Connections on Discrete Surfaces](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/TrivialConnections/). This application was created as the final project for the course *IN4310 Seminar Computer Graphics* at Delft University of Technology.
